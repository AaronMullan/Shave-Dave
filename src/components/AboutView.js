          <p><b>ABOUT: ShaveDave for Ukraine Relief</b><br /><br />
            Shave Dave was created in 2011 by Dave Spence and Paul Hartman to raise money for Tsunami Relief in Japan. We subsequently ran several successful fundraisers for The National MS Society until Dave retired from the bar business in 2015. The COVID-19 Virus is forced the beard out of retirement in 2020. This year we will be raising money for the non-profit Baltimore Sister City Odesa to provide assistance to citizens of Ukraine so adversely affected by the crisis there. We will also be donating money to Hamilton-Lauraville Main Street. This year will be in person at The 4500 Lot at Hamilton-Lauraville Main Street and livestreamed here and on other social media platforms. The shave will be held on Saturday, June 25, 2022.

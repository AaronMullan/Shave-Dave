          <b>ShaveDave for Ukraine Relief</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Shave Dave was created in 2011 by Dave Spence and Paul Hartman to
          raise money for Tsunami Relief in Japan. We subsequently ran several
          successful fundraisers for The National MS Society until Dave retired
          from the bar business in 2015. The COVID-19 Virus is forced the beard
          out of retirement in 2020. This year we will be raising money for the
          non-profit Baltimore Sister City Odesa to provide assistance to
          citizens of Ukraine so adversely affected by the crisis there. We will
          also be donating money to Hamilton-Lauraville Main Street.
          (Hamilton-Lauraville Main Street and Baltimore Sister Cities, Inc are
          public charities recognized as tax-exempt by the IRS under Section
          501(c)(3).)  This year will be in person at The 4500 Lot at
          Hamilton-Lauraville Main Street and livestreamed here and on other
          social media platforms. The shave will be held on Saturday, June 25,
          2022.

            On June 25, we will host a Live Variety Show accepting pledges up
            until 5:00PM SHARP. The beard style that collects the most donations
            by that time will be the style Dave is shaved, LIVE and LIVESTREAMED
            here and to your favorite social networks. It’ll be a HOOT and all
            for a good cause.
